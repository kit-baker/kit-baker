## I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Earth Sciences, University of Cambridge, researching applications of clumped isotopes to paleoclimate research. 
Some of my work focusses on - 
 :writing_hand: developing an updated temperature calibration for clumped isotopes using cave pearls
 :snail: using gastropod shells to investigate temperature changes in the Yucatan Peninsula
 :ocean: applying clumped isotopes to foraminifera from the Iberian margin
